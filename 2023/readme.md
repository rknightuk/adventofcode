# Advent of Code 2023

## Format

Each day has it's own folder with three files:

- `input.php` - the input for solving the puzzle
- `1.php` - code for part one of the puzzle
- `2.php` - code for part two of the puzzle, if attempted

Additional files like alternate versions will also be in the each folder.

Run with `php {filename}.php`
